<h3> Multi level routing with Express.js </h3> 

I just started with Javascript. While learning, wanted to make RESTfull API and learn routing in Express.js.
This code demonstrates the routing procedure.

<h3> How to use </h3>
To run this sample, download the contents to /path/to/directory and then
```
$ cd /path/to/directory
$ npm install express --save    # installs express.js
$ npm start                     # start server
```
After this, open your favourite web browser and go to
```
http://localhost:12345
http://localhost:12345/api
http://localhost:12345/api/location
http://localhost:12345/api/location/india
```
to test the working.
